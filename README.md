### Parasoft DTP & minikube

Steps:
```
git clone https://github.com/daparic/dtp-minikube.git
cd dtp-minikube

./minikube-start.sh
```

Once minikube setup is done, Parasoft DTP may need a few more minutes to initialize. When it has initialized, test open in browser the http url corresponding to *http-server/8080*.
